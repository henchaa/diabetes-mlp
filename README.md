# Diabetes Classification with MLP
This repository contains a Python implementation of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for binary classification on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The code includes data preprocessing, training, and evaluation, producing loss/accuracy curves and a confusion matrix.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- Dataset: diabetes.csv (included)

## Usage
Run `diabetes_mlp.py` to train the model and generate plots.

## Results
- Accuracy: ~73%
- Outputs: training_curves.png, confusion_matrix.png
