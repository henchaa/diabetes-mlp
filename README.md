# diabetes-mlp
This study presents the design and implementation of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for binary classification of diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The MLP, implemented in Python without deep learning frameworks, employs manual forward propagation, backpropagation, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization.
